# Hack_Princeton_Project

To run this program, first install all of the python dependencies listed within App.py's import statements.  Start the Flask Server using the command 'python testserver.py 12345'.
You should now be able to see our homepage on your localhost's address - 127.0.0.1:12345 (type this into your URL bar like a website).  
To install our extension go to chrome://extensions/ in your URL bar and toggle on 'Developer mode' in the top right corner.  
Click 'Load unpacked' in the top left corner and choose the 'extensions' folder from this project.  Now the extension should be up and running.
If you go to hbo.com, it should deny you entry.  If you go to netflix.com, it should allow you entry, as your task to use Netflix has been completed in our database.

Enjoy!
